# Photo Share Backend

Made as an exercise in an afternoon, to be seen with the Photo Share Frontend repo

## Requirements
java 21+
maven 3.8+

## Running
```
mvn clean package
java -jar target/PhotoShare-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Testing

Really I just used the IDE testing support, you're on your own for running it via cli.
